    "## Machine Learning with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a branch in computer science that studies the design of algorithms that can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical tasks are concept learning, function learning or “predictive modeling”, clustering and finding predictive patterns. These tasks are learned through available data that were observed through experiences or instructions, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hope that comes with this discipline is that including the experience into its tasks will eventually improve the learning. But this improvement needs to happen in such a way that the learning itself becomes automatic so that humans like ourselves don’t need to interfere anymore is the ultimate goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s scikit-learn tutorial will introduce you to the basics of Python machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1: You'll learn how to use Python and its libraries to explore your data with the help of matplotlib and Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\n",
    "- Part 2a: And you'll preprocess your data with normalization and you'll split your data into training and test sets.\n",
    "- Part 2b: Next, you'll work with the well-known KMeans algorithm to construct an unsupervised model, fit this model to your data, predict values, and validate the model that you have built.\n",
    "- Part 3: As an extra, you'll also see how you can also use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to construct another model to classify your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move to part 2 now."

    "## K-means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have even more information about your data and you have a visualization ready, it does seem a bit like the data points sort of group together, but you also see there is quite some overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be interesting to investigate further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think that, in a case where you knew that there are 10 possible digits labels to assign to the data points, but you have no access to the labels, the observations would group or “cluster” together by some criterion in such a way that you could infer the labels?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is an analytical question called __unsupervised learning__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you have acquired a good understanding of your data, you have to decide on the use cases that would be relevant to your data set. In other words, you think about what your data set might teach you or what you think you can learn from your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there on, you can think about what kind of algorithms you would be able to apply to your data set in order to get the results that you think you can obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: the more familiar you are with your data, the easier it will be to assess the use cases for your specific data set. The same also holds for finding the appropriate machine algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you’re first getting started with `scikit-learn`, you’ll see that the amount of algorithms that the library contains is pretty vast and that you might still want additional help when you’re doing the assessment for your data set. That’s why the below `scikit-learn` machine learning map will come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png' />\n",
    "[Image Source](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this map does require you to have some knowledge about the algorithms that are included in the `scikit-learn `library. This, by the way, also holds some truth for taking this next step in your project: if you have no idea what is possible, it will be very hard to decide on what your use case will be for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As your use case was one for clustering, you can follow the path on the map towards “KMeans”. You’ll see the use case that you have just thought about requires you to have more than 50 samples (“check!”), to have labeled data (“check!”), to know the number of categories that you want to predict (“check!”) and to have less than 10K samples (“check!”).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what exactly is the __K-Means__ algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the simplest and widely used __unsupervised learning__ algorithms to solve __clustering__ problems. The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters that you have set before you run the algorithm. This number of clusters is called `k` and you select this number at your discretion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the k-means algorithm will find the __nearest cluster center__ for each data point and assign the closest data point to that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all data points have been assigned to clusters, the cluster centers will be recomputed. In other words, new cluster centers will emerge from the average of the values of the cluster data points. This process is repeated until most data points stick to the same cluster. The cluster membership should stabilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can already see that, because the k-means algorithm works the way it does, the initial set of cluster centers that you give up can have a __big effect__ on the clusters that are eventually found. You can, of course, deal with this effect, as you will see further on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before you can go into making a model for your data, you should definitely take a look into preparing your data for this purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first import the `digits` data from `scikit-learn` `datasets` again. If you don't remember how to do so, please refer to part 1 of this project."

    "- The __homogeneity__ (`homo`) score tells you to what extent all of the clusters contain only data points which are members of a single class.\n",
    "- The __completeness__ (`compl`) score measures the extent to which all of the data points that are members of a given class are also elements of the same cluster - e.g. how many `0`s in cluster `0`.\n",
    "- The __V-measure__ (`v-meas`) score is the harmonic mean between homogeneity and completeness.\n",
    "- The adjusted Rand index (`ARI`) measures the similarity between two clusterings and considers all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings.\n",
    "- The Adjusted Mutual Info (`AMI`) score is used to compare clusters. It measures the similarity between the data points that are in the clusterings, accounting for chance groupings and takes a maximum value of 1 when clusterings are equivalent.\n",
    "- The `silhouette` score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette scores ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher value indicates that the object is better matched to its own cluster and worse mached to neighboring clusters. If many points have a high value, the clusteirng configuration is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "You clearly see that these scores aren’t fantastic: for example, you see that the value for the `silhouette` score is close to `0`, which indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters. This could indicate that the samples could have been assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the `ARI` measure seems to indicate that not all data points in a given cluster are similar and the `completeness` score tells you that there are definitely data points that weren’t put in the right cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looks like we did not do too well using __unsupervised, cluster__ models, in the next part we will try a __supervised learning__ model to see if the results will improve.\n",
